Authors Meir fuchs && Ginton

The project describes a graph when every edge has a weight. 
example for graph here:

# Algorithm:
isConnected: if there is a valid path from EVREY node to each - is connected else- isn't connected. use in DFS

short distance: the length of the shortest path between source vertex to destination vertex. Use Dijkstra algoritem

shortest Path Distance: the the shortest path between src to dest - as an ordered List of nodes:
src--> n1-->n2-->...dest
 
TSP: computes a relatively short path which visit each node in the targets List.
