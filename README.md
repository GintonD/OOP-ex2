# OOP- ex2 The Maze of Waze
Authors Meir fuchs && Ginton Durlacher

The project describes a graph when every edge has a weight. 
example for graph here:

![Test Image 1](https://github.com/GintonD/OOP-ex2/blob/master/graphPaint.png?raw=true)

# Algorithm:
isConnected: if there is a valid path from EVREY node to each - is connected else- isn't connected. use in DFS

Short distance: the length of the shortest path between source vertex to destination vertex. Use Dijkstra algoritem

Shortest Path Distance: the the shortest path between src to dest - as an ordered List of nodes:
src--> n1-->n2-->...dest
 
TSP: computes a relatively short path which visit each node in the targets List.
 
 # How To Use:
 For crate graph you have 2 options:
 
 1. init from a file in your computer: the file shoule be from the format Java. 
 2. Automatic Random graph
 
 After your choise you have to click on the screen.
 
 After eveyry operation in th gui the graph will Update!!
 
 Save- you can save the file to your folder.
 
 Algorithm :
 
 Short distance: choose the sourch and destination. The program tell the distance from source to destination.
 
 Shortest Path: choose the sourch and destination. The program tell the path from source to destination.
 
 TSP: tell how many targets you want. choose the target. the program draw the new graph with the path.
 
 Isconnected: screen tell you if in this graph you can go from each vertex to other.
